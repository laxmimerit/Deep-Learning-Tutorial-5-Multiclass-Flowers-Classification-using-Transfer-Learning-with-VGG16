In this video, we explore how to use VGG16 with transfer learning to perform multiclass flower classification. Transfer learning is a powerful technique that enables us to leverage pre-trained models to solve complex tasks with relatively small datasets. By the end of the video, you'll have a better understanding of how to apply transfer learning to your own image classification projects.
